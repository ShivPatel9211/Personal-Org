# Ideas for Potential Improvements

## 1. PDF to PNG Conversion
- Implement a feature to convert PDF files to PNG format on the fly. This would enhance compatibility with Tesseract.js, which primarily supports image files.
- Use a library like `pdfjs-dist` to convert PDF pages to images.

## 2. Multi-page PDF Support
- Extend the functionality to handle multi-page PDFs by converting each page to an image and processing them sequentially.
- Aggregate the OCR results from each page into a single output.

## 3. Enhance User Interface
- Add a progress indicator for file uploads and OCR processing to improve user experience.
- Display thumbnail previews of uploaded files.
- Provide options for users to select specific pages or areas of the document for OCR.

## 4. Error Handling and Notifications
- Implement robust error handling for various scenarios such as unsupported file types, large file sizes, and OCR failures.
- Provide user-friendly error messages and notifications.

## 5. Customizable OCR Settings
- Allow users to customize OCR settings such as language selection, image preprocessing options, and text extraction modes.
- Provide a settings panel or modal for these configurations.

## 6. Text Post-processing
- Implement text post-processing features such as spell check, text formatting, and data extraction.
- Integrate with external APIs or services for additional text analysis and processing.

## 7. Save and Export Results
- Add functionality to save OCR results to Salesforce records or export them as text files, PDFs, or other formats.
- Provide options for users to copy the extracted text to the clipboard.

## 8. Accessibility Enhancements
- Ensure the components are accessible and compliant with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
- Provide keyboard navigation support and screen reader compatibility.

## 9. Localization and Internationalization
- Add support for multiple languages and localization of the user interface.
- Ensure the OCR component can handle text extraction in various languages and scripts.

## 10. Optimized Performance
- Optimize the performance of the OCR process by implementing efficient file handling and image processing techniques.
- Consider using web workers or other asynchronous processing methods to prevent UI blocking during OCR operations.

## 11. Advanced Logging and Debugging
- Implement advanced logging and debugging options to help developers diagnose issues during development and deployment.
- Provide a debug mode that logs detailed information about the OCR process.

## 12. Integration with Salesforce Data Models
- Allow users to map extracted text to Salesforce fields and records directly from the component.
- Provide a configuration interface for users to define data mappings and associations.
